Examples 
----------------------------------------------------
		Example of repeating function in VBA (Counting up)

Sub Star()

For Row_ = 2 To 10

        Star_count = 0
    For Col_ = 4 To 8
    
        If Cells(Row_, Col_).Value = "Full-Star" Then
            Star_count = Star_count + 1
        End If


    Next Col_
            Cells(Row_, 9).Value = Star_count
 
Next Row_


End Sub

Notes

For Row_ = 2 to 10 (This now will read through the row/collem depending on its position in the cell (X, Y))

		Star_count = 0 (Defines varible)
	for Col_ = 4 to 8 (This now will read through the row/collem depending on its position in the cell (X, Y))
